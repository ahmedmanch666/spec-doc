You already analyzed the project and confirmed that:

- The app runs in production at http://localhost:65130/
- The public UI uses a Layout wrapper
- AR/EN toggle works and flips RTL/LTR and fonts
- Theme red/white tokens are wired
- Home, Case Studies, Contact, and admin login/dashboard routes exist

However, the site is still incomplete from a product/UI perspective.

Please treat the following as the **authoritative spec** of what the EIBS site and CMS MUST contain, then:

1) Compare the current implementation to this spec.
2) List the gaps briefly.
3) Implement the missing UI/pages/layouts/components to match the spec as much as possible WITHOUT breaking any of the working parts you found.

=== SPEC OVERVIEW ===

Brand & Design System

  - Primary red: #D90429

=== WHAT TO DO NOW ===

1) Use the existing code that you already validated as a starting point.
2) Compare every public page and admin section against the spec above.
3) For each gap (missing page, missing section, missing component, missing header/footer on a route, or missing AR/EN mirror), implement the minimum required UI to align with the spec.
4) Reuse the existing mock data and types where possible rather than inventing a whole new data layer.
5) Do NOT break what is already working (AR/EN toggle, existing Case Studies/Contact/CMS Login/Dashboard).
6) After changes, build and run the production server again and verify:
   - Header & footer render on ALL public routes.
   - All public pages exist and show at least a basic, correct layout matching the spec.
   - AR/EN toggle flips dir/fonts everywhere.
   - /admin/login and /admin/dashboard still function.
   - No critical console errors.

Finally, output a short summary:
- What was missing.
- What you implemented.
- Any TODOs left that require manual content or design tweaks.
